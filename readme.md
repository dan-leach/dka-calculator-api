# BSPED Paediatric DKA Calculator API

A Express.js API calculating variables required for individualised versions of the **integrated care pathway for the management of children and young people under the age of 18 years with Diabetic Ketoacidosis** (2021) in line with [BSPED guidance](https://www.bsped.org.uk/clinical-resources/bsped-dka-guidelines/).

This API is designed to be used with BSPED Paediatric DKA Calculator Client, see repository <https://github.com/dan-leach/dka-calculator>.

The BSPED Paediatric DKA Calculator is registered as a medical device with the MHRA.

## API

The API is served from `https://api.dka-calculator.co.uk/`. The various functions of the API include validating and performing calculations on the input variables, generating unique episode IDs, inserting audit variables into the SQL database and returning the calculations and episode IDs to the client.

The API is tested with each update. The testing schema can be found in `tests.json`. [Run tests via Postman here](https://universal-capsule-155462.postman.co/workspace/dka-calculator-api~e0a7b736-5f9f-4f56-881c-c2e0cad82ec4/run/create?collection=14785026-e21a63d3-1d02-44e0-acf0-606e604a5ece&type=manual-run&tab=functional).
